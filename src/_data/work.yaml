    title: Principal Engineer

      My role at Smartsheet is quite broad. I'm on the team rebuilding the core "sheet" product. That includes the grid/card/gannt/calenar views.
      <br><br>
      My primary focus has been how to scale the product to meet the data expectations set by customers. I also spearheaded the realtime collaboration portion of the app which allows all logged-in users on a sheet see what other users are doing. This was particularly challenging because we needed to process, commit, and transfer action to all users in under a second.
