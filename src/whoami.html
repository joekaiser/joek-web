            <p>
                I've spent the majority of my career working at startups, and as a result I've
                picked up quite a few skills. I guess you could call me a "full stack" developer.
            </p>

            <p>
                I know my way around data modeling, database tuning, scale-able architecture,
                frontend code, service design, performance, and cloud architecture to name a few.
            </p>
            <p>My passions are building a product, solving problems, and mentoring.</p>
